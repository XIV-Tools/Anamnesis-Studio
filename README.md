# Anamnesis Studio
Anamnesis Studio is a standalone tool that is used to modify certain clientside-only values and allow the user a greater degree of flexibility for making creative and interesting screenshots. In short, this tool allows its users to temporarily change their race, gender, looks, equipment, etc. in game without actually making any changes visible to other players. This tool also allows users to create their own poses. 

Anamnesis Studio is the successor to  [Anamnesis](https://github.com/imchillin/Anamnesis) and [Concept Matrix (CMTool)](https://github.com/imchillin/CMTool).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 6.0 Desktop Runtime x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.6-windows-x64-installer) installed on your computer. Anamnesis Studio will only work with 64-bit versions of Windows. Support will not be added for x86/32-bit versions of Windows (As Patch 6.15 Final Fantasy XIV [doesn't support 32 bit OS anymore](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/73031a839564edaca5f4bce18043b9b0e339b52a))
- Windows 10 or 11 (there are no plans to add support for older versions of Windows that [Microsoft is not in turn supporting](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/windows-7-end-of-life-support-information), or other operating systems).

### Installation

Download the latest build from [the releases page](https://github.com/XIV-Tools/Anamnesis-Studio/releases/latest), then simply extract it to your location of choice, log in to the game, and run the tool.
